/*
 * Write a C program to check whether a given number (N) is a perfect number or not.
 * [Perfect Number - A perfect number is a positive integer number which is equals to the sum of its proper positive divisors. 
 * For example 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 and itâ€™s sum is equals to 6.]
 *
 * Private Test cases used for evaluation:  Input	Expected Output	            Actual Output	           Status
 * Test Case 1:                             8128    8128 is a perfect number.  8128 is a perfect number.  Passed
 * 
 * Test Case 2:                             8000    8000 is not a perfect number.  8000 is not a perfect number.  Passed
 * 
 * Sample solutions (Provided by instructor):
